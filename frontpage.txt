/*Detailed View*/
Create window that will display the information of a cookie. 
It should be dynamic so that it can easily be updated from selectly from the cookie.
Selecting the cookie should be able to be done from the table and potentialy other sources.

Perhaps show the cookie info using a form. Each piece of data will have it's own
textbox/textarea, which will be automatically populated with the info from the database
when the row in the table is clicked. From there, the user will be able to directly
edit the form and save or undo their changes. Perhaps they could also save the info
as a new cookie.

/*Botton Row*/
Functionality to the bottons needs to be added.
Delete button should be able to delete the cookie not only on the database but on the users computer as well.
Randomize Cookie should randomize specific values that we decided on like anything with location data.
Something Else to Cookie will probably become Modify Cookie to allow users to modify what they want.
Save as new would create a new cookie and populate it with info from the form.
Future stuff might be some sort of smart randomize, which will detect what type of data the cookie holds
and randomize it within the possible values of that data. For example, it might see a value is 37916, detect
it as a zip code, and change it to 11422, another valid zip code. Yet still a random one.
